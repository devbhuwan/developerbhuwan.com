= The Example : Student Management System

=== UNDERSTAND -> (Event Storming)

First of all, let's discover domain events on student management system.

Then, identify cause of each domain event like:

Now, identifying invariants or conditions of each Domain Event

image::docs/3.Identifying invariants or conditions of each Domain Event.jpg[Identifying invariants or conditions of each Domain Event]

Let's write down the name of a query/view that the system needs to check during processing each invariant.

Now, let's divide into highly cohesive modules so called bounded context.

Then, we need to identifying how to modules communicate with each other.

Finally, we need to do snap analysis using Spring Stacks for each bounded context.
